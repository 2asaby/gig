My First Gig 

Design python app that runs on Raspberry Pi kit and Dockerize the app  

Steps: 

Design a Python app with three versions, each implementing a different encryption technique. 

Configure the testing environment and conduct tests on the application. 

Dockerized the app to ensure a consistent environment on both my system and the client's system, preventing any configuration conflicts. 

Push Dockerized image to my Docker hub repository, you can pull it from that link

I uploaded all code snippets and screenshots to my GitHub repository in three .RAR files, each corresponding to a different encryption technique. and one .RAR file for the Dockerized app.
