My First Gig 

Design python app that runs on Raspberry Pi kit and Dockerize the app  

Steps: 

Design python app with 3 versions that implement 3 different encryption techniques. 

Set up the testing environment and test the app. 

Dockerized the app to ensure a consistent environment on both my system and the client's system, preventing any configuration conflicts. 

Push Dockerized image to my Docker hub repository, you can pull it from that link 

 

“ docker pull 2asaby/encryption_app_new:latest ” 

 

I uploaded all code snippets and screenshots to my GitHub repository in three .RAR files, each corresponding to a different encryption technique.
